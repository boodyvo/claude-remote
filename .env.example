# Claude Remote Runner - Environment Variables
# ============================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# Never commit .env to version control!

# ============================================
# Claude Code Authentication
# ============================================
# This project uses Claude Pro/Max subscription via 'claude login' (NOT API key)
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. On your server, run: claude login
# 2. Follow the browser authentication flow
# 3. Verify with: claude → /status (should show "Claude Pro" or "Claude Max")
#
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
# - If set, it overrides subscription and charges API costs
# - Credentials are stored in ~/.claude/ directory
# - This directory is mounted to containers via docker-compose.yml
#
# Cost: Fixed $20/month (Pro) or $200/month (Max) - included in your subscription

# - Limit ALLOWED_USER_IDS to trusted users only
#
# Costs:
